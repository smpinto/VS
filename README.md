This repository contains the code and documents for a research project on decomposing labor force participation growth. The primary objective is to analyze the contribution of immigration to changes in the labor force over time. The project includes the source code used for the decomposition analysis and the final PDF report, which presents the methodology, findings, and conclusions. This resource is intended to provide a transparent and reproducible foundation for understanding the complex relationship between immigration and labor force dynamics.
